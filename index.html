I'll create a

can you write me an interactive web app to be used by an nhs trust as an information asset register? the app should be used to record information assets and data flows so two sections will be needed. The app should also contain a user management system where new users can be created by the main admin account. Information assets and data flows will be assigned to specific teams so the ability to select teams is important - individuals can then be assigned to these teams and granted read only or edit permissions to the information assets and data flows relevant automatically. I would like to give the admin the ability to create the forms required for the information assets and data flows directly within the app please if possible? If you need any clarity before creating the app please ask me to ensure I don't burn through my usage as quick as I may if not

15:40
Great, I have a few clarifying questions to ensure I build exactly what you need:

Core Functionality
Form Builder: When you say the admin can "create the forms" for information assets and data flows - do you mean:
A drag-and-drop form builder where admin defines which fields appear (e.g., add a "Data Classification" dropdown, a "Retention Period" text field, etc.)?
Or pre-defined templates that admin can customise (add/remove/edit fields)?
Data Flows: Should data flows link to information assets (e.g., "Flow X transfers Asset Y from Team A to Team B"), or are they independent records?
User & Team Structure
Team Hierarchy: Can a user belong to multiple teams, or just one?
Permissions: You mentioned read-only or edit. Should there also be:
A "submit for approval" workflow?
An audit trail of who changed what and when?
Admin Levels: Is there just one super-admin, or do you need team-level admins who can manage their own team's users?
NHS-Specific
Data Classifications: Should I pre-populate NHS-standard classifications (e.g., Official, Official-Sensitive, etc.) as defaults in the form builder?
Export/Reporting: Do you need the ability to export registers to Excel/CSV or generate reports (e.g., for IG toolkit submissions)?
Technical
Data Persistence: Since this is a web app I'll create, the data will be stored in browser local storage (resets if you clear browser data). For a production NHS system you'd need a proper backend. Is this acceptable for a prototype/demo, or do you need something more persistent?
Let me know your preferences and I'll build it accordingly.

pre defined templates, so an information asset template and a data flows template - the administration can then set the required fields for this - perhaps in another section called forms admin that only full administrator accounts have access too?
data flows can be assigned to info assets but not required
yes a user can belong to multiple teams
leave as read-only and edit for the individual teams
Create a sys admin level which users can be assigned to which gives permission to everything within the system and the ability to edit the forms
No need to pre define anything.
Yes please provide ability to export data
Yes local storage is fine for demo.
If there any any more clarification points needed please ask before creating app

Thank you, that's very helpful. Just a few final clarifications:

Forms Admin
Field Types: What field types should the admin be able to add to forms? I'm thinking:
Text (single line)
Text area (multi-line)
Dropdown (with custom options)
Date
Checkbox (yes/no)
Multi-select (multiple options)
Are there any others you'd need?
Field Validation: Should admin be able to mark fields as "required" or "optional"?
Teams & Assets
Team Assignment: When creating/editing an information asset or data flow, should the user be able to assign it to:
One team only?
Multiple teams?
Visibility: If an asset is assigned to Team A, can users from Team B see it at all (even read-only), or is it completely hidden from them?
User Management
Default Admin: Should I create a default sys admin account (e.g., username: admin, password: admin) for initial login, which can then create other users?
User Details: What information should be captured for users?
Username
Password
Full name
Email
Team assignments
Role (Sys Admin / Standard User)
Anything else?
Data Flows
Linking to Assets: When linking a data flow to an information asset, should it show all assets in the system, or only assets the user has access to?
Once you confirm these I'll have everything I need to build it.

yes those types are fine
yes please
Each asset and data flow should only be assigned to one team as the owner
No this shouldn't be possible they should be private
yes thats great
yes those are fine
Assets the user has access to as they should have access all assets within that specific team only
15:46
Perfect, I have everything I need. Let me build this for you now.

Creating a comprehensive NHS Information Asset Register web application - complete file
nhs-asset-register.html

Presented file
I've created your NHS Information Asset Register application. Here's what's included:

Login & Authentication

Default credentials: admin / admin
System Administrator role with full access
Standard User role with team-based permissions
User Management (Sys Admin only)

Create, edit, delete users
Assign users to multiple teams with read-only or edit permissions
Team Management (Sys Admin only)

Create and manage teams
View member counts, asset counts, and data flow counts per team
Forms Administration (Sys Admin only)

Customise Information Asset and Data Flow form templates
Field types: text, text area, dropdown, date, checkbox, multi-select
Mark fields as required/optional
Information Assets

Add, edit, view, delete assets (based on team permissions)
Assets are private to their assigned team
Search and filter by team
Export to CSV
Data Flows

Add, edit, view, delete data flows (based on team permissions)
Optionally link to information assets within the same team
Search and filter by team
Export to CSV
Permissions Logic

Users only see assets/data flows for teams they belong to
Read-only users can view but not edit
Edit users can create, modify, and delete
System Administrators have full access to everything
Data is stored in browser local storage, so it will persist between sessions but would need a proper backend for production use.

can you change the default forms for me to contain the following:

Information assets:
Portfolio
Team (where assignment is managed for services)
Asset name
description
storage location
date reviewed
data next review due
risk score (1-8)
likelihood of risk (1-8)
total risk (risk score * likelihood of risk) auto filled

Data flows:
Portfolio
Team (where assignment is managed for services)
Linked to asset (search box to look for available assets)
description
description of how data flows
storage location
date reviewed
data next review due
risk score (1-8)
likelihood of risk (1-8)
total risk (risk score * likelihood of risk) auto filled

And then change dashboard page to include some more reports which edit based on assets you have access to? Mainly total assets, total assets in data, total assets due for review - then provide click through options to view these pieces of information?

I've updated the application with all your requested changes. Here's a summary:

Updated Information Asset Form Fields:

Portfolio, Team, Asset Name, Description, Storage Location, Date Reviewed, Date Next Review Due, Risk Score (1-8 dropdown), Likelihood of Risk (1-8 dropdown), Total Risk (auto-calculated)
Updated Data Flow Form Fields:

Portfolio, Team, Description, Description of How Data Flows, Storage Location, Date Reviewed, Date Next Review Due, Risk Score (1-8 dropdown), Likelihood of Risk (1-8 dropdown), Total Risk (auto-calculated)
Enhanced Dashboard with Clickable Reports:

Top Row - Main Stats (clickable to navigate):

Total Assets → clicks through to Assets list
Total Data Flows → clicks through to Data Flows list
Teams → clicks through to Team Management
Users → clicks through to User Management
Asset Review Status (clickable filters):

Assets Overdue for Review (red) → filters to show only overdue
Assets Due Within 30 Days (yellow) → filters to show due soon
Assets Up to Date (green) → filters to show reviewed
Data Flow Review Status (clickable filters):

Same three categories as assets
Risk Overview Panels:

Asset Risk Overview showing High (49-64), Medium (25-48), Low (1-24) counts
Data Flow Risk Overview with same breakdown
Other Improvements:

Total Risk auto-calculates when you select Risk Score and Likelihood
Table views show Next Review date with colour-coded status icons
Total Risk displays with colour coding in tables
View modals show calculated Total Risk with risk level label
CSV exports include the calculated Total Risk
Note: Since this uses local storage, you may need to clear your browser's local storage to see the new default form fields if you had previously used the app.

One more change, on both forms the owner team should be the only option for team, no need to provide another option for people to type something in here

16:05

Remove the Team text field from asset form fields since Owner Team dropdown already handles this

nhs-asset-register.html

Presented file
Done. I've removed the separate "Team" text field from both the Information Asset and Data Flow forms. The "Owner Team" dropdown at the top of each form is now the only way to assign a team, which makes sense since that's what controls permissions and visibility anyway.

can you help me deploy this via github so I have a version hosted I can access and test

16:09
Absolutely! I can guide you through deploying this using GitHub Pages, which is free and straightforward. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

Go to https://github.com and sign up
Step 2: Create a New Repository

Click the + icon in the top right → New repository
Name it something like nhs-asset-register
Set it to Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
Check Add a README file
Click Create repository
Step 3: Upload the HTML File

In your new repository, click Add file → Upload files
Drag and drop the nhs-asset-register.html file you downloaded
Important: Rename the file to index.html (GitHub Pages looks for this filename)
You can do this before uploading, or after by clicking the file → pencil icon → change the filename at the top
Click Commit changes
Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

Go to your repository's Settings (tab at the top)
Scroll down to Pages in the left sidebar
Under Source, select Deploy from a branch
Under Branch, select main and / (root)
Click Save
Step 5: Access Your Site

Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
Your site will be live at: https://[your-username].github.io/nhs-asset-register/
Would you like me to create a ready-to-use repository package with the file already named index.html and a README with instructions? That would make it even easier to upload.

The site for my hosted app is: https://karlvincent7-cpu.github.io/Info-asset-register/#

Just putting this here as a place holder as I will now be doing some testing. Default admin is: admin/admin too keeping this here as only I have access

16:14
Noted - I've saved that for reference:

Live Site: https://karlvincent7-cpu.github.io/Info-asset-register/#

Default Admin: admin / admin

Let me know when you've finished testing and if you need any changes, bug fixes, or new features. Happy to help!

my next step is to try make it reactive so that is scales for iphone screen usage, is this possible?

16:15
Yes, absolutely! The app already uses Tailwind CSS which has responsive utilities built in, but it needs some adjustments to work well on mobile screens. The main issues will be:

Sidebar - needs to collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile
Tables - need to scroll horizontally or stack on small screens
Modals - need better sizing for mobile
Dashboard cards - need to stack properly
Would you like me to make these responsive changes now? I'll:

Add a hamburger menu button that shows/hides the sidebar on mobile
Make the sidebar overlay the screen on mobile rather than push content
Ensure tables scroll horizontally on small screens
Adjust padding and font sizes for mobile
Make sure modals are full-width on small screens
Ensure dashboard stat cards stack nicely
Just confirm and I'll update the app for you.

Done! The app is now fully responsive for mobile devices. Here's what I've changed:

Navigation:

Added a hamburger menu button (☰) that appears on mobile
Sidebar slides in from the left when tapped, with a dark overlay behind it
Tapping the overlay or a menu item closes the sidebar
Header text shortened on mobile to fit better
Dashboard:

Stats cards now display in a 2x2 grid on mobile (4 columns on desktop)
Smaller fonts and padding on mobile
"Click to view" hints hidden on mobile to save space
Tables:

Tables scroll horizontally on small screens
Some columns hidden on mobile/tablet to prioritise key information:
Assets: Owner, Asset Name, Risk, Actions always visible; Portfolio and Next Review hidden on smaller screens
Data Flows: Similar approach
Users: Full Name and Email hidden on mobile
Teams: Description, Assets, and Data Flows counts hidden on smaller screens
Smaller padding and font sizes
Modals:

All modals now take full width on mobile with small margins
Sticky headers so you can always see what modal you're in
Smaller padding and fonts on mobile
General:

Buttons show icons only on mobile, full text on desktop
Touch-friendly tap targets (added padding to buttons)
All form inputs sized appropriately for mobile
You can now upload this new version to your GitHub repository to replace the existing file. Test it on your iPhone and it should work much better!
